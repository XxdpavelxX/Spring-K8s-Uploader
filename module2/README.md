## Requirement:
Operate multiple instances (which we call _realms_) of our Intelligent Business Cloud (IBC) all around the world across multiple cloud providers. Their configuration (e.g. database hosts, connectivity to external services) is slightly different for each realm. Challenges of sketching and deploying the solution described below.


## Considerations: 
Operating multiple instances of an IBC across different regions and cloud providers presents several challenges and considerations, such as the following:

** 1. Managing Configurations: ** Managing and maintaining configuration files for each realm across multiple cloud providers can be complex. This would ensure managing configurations that may slightly different. Ensuring consistency and correctness across all environments could prove to be a tricky challenge and a lot of work as new changes are made. On the IAC side you would likely have to maintain multiple repos of terraform code for each cloud provider and need to replicate infrastructure changes to each of them. 

** 2. Deployment Consistency: ** Deploying updates or new features to multiple realms, and cloud providers simultaneously while maintaining consistency and minimizing downtime might be a challenge. It might be best to have this managed by separate CI/CD pipelines that will have to be maintained separately.

** 3. Security Requirements and Compliance: ** Another challenge would be meeting security and compliance standards across all realms, and cloud providers. Especially when dealing with sensitive data. Different regions and cloud providers may have different compliance requirements. For different cloud providers this would include using different internal cloud tools or separate integrations with 3rd party services.

** 4. Data Transfer Costs: ** If necessary transferring data between regions or cloud providers would incur additional costs, which would need to be considered in the design and deployment strategy.

## Potential Solutions:

** 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): ** Using IaC tools such as Terraform or AWS CDK to define and manage infrastructure configurations will help manage and keep track of the infrastructure across realms and cloud environments. To help address the challenge of maintaining multiple terraform repos we could use modules, however these would still need to be different across cloud providers. This could be tracked in a version control system such as Git for increased visibility of changes.

** 2. Configuration Management: ** To help manage server configurations I would use tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. This would help keep track of configuration files, and ensure consistency across environments. Configuration files could be stored in a version control system such as Git to track changes, increase visbility, and allow for rollbacks if needed.

** 3. CI/CD Pipelines and Deployment: ** Adding CI/CD pipelines would greatly reduce the manual workload across realms and cloud providers. CI/CD pipelines could be used to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes. Potential tools for this include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, AWS CodePipeline, Github Actions, and much more. Using a CI/CD workflow would make it easier to deploy to multiple realms efficiently, although we may need to create and maintain multiple pipelines. Automated deployment strategies would into account the unique characteristics of each region and cloud provider (ie data residency requirements, latency, and cost).

** 4. Monitoring, Alerting, and logging: ** To improve visibility across our realms and cloud providers I would implement metrics, monitors and alerting solutions to detect and notify me of potential issues. This could be done using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch, Datadog or NewRelic (among others) to monitor the health and performance of environments and set up alerts for critical metrics. Alerting and notifications could be done by tools such as AWS SNS or PagerDuty. It would also be good to aggregate the metrics and monitoring into one location such as Datadog or NewRelic so a user doesn't have to login to multiple cloud providers to get visibility. Same for logging.

** 5. Documentation: ** Having reliable up to date documentation to explain how everything works across realms, environments, and cloud providers will be essential. Documentation would include README.md files in code repos explaining how the service works, should be tested, and any other relevant information. And also wikis explaining deployment strategies, CI/CD processes, monitoring/alerting, security standards, and other crucial aspects of the Intelligent Business Cloud
